# Airgap Bootstrap

### Proposition

Create an artefact in an online environment that is copied to the offline airgapped environment.

Artefact contains everything needed to standup an instance of AWX, the open-source version of Ansible Tower. Artefact should also contain playbooks for Kubernetes and other shared services required, such as JIRA, Confluence, Gitlab, Artifactory, etc.
